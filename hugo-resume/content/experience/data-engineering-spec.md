In this position, I was the primary Data Engineer on an 18-month cloud-native redesign of the data processing system that produces official statistics on Canadian Travel and Tourism.

- The system redesign was delivered on-time at a cost significantly lower than the next best alternative with all essential features met.

- Accelerated monthly delivery by automating workflows and migrating legacy SAS and SQL scripts to the modern Python Data Science ecosystem, reducing end-to-end times of complex data processing programs.

- Minimized total cost of ownership by replacing high-maintenance licensed software solutions with well-documented, maintainable open-source solutions.
