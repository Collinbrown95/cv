In this role, I rotated across two different teams at Statistics Canada, and one team in the Public Health Agency of Canada (on secondment) doing platform development work.
The key outcomes I delivered in this role are as follows.

- De-risked high-priority initiatives by developing proof-of-concepts (PoCs) to validate feasibility and business value, and provide stakeholders with an evidence-driven approach to make "Go/No-Go" decisions.

- Expanded Kubernetes platform capabilities by developing secure connectivity to certain internal services, a custom S3-to-Azure Blob proxy, and specialized node pools for targeted workloads.

- Optimized cloud spend by decommissioning underutilized infrastructure and right-sizing workloads to align with actual resource demands.
